Continuing the tradition of creating games for Vim, here is a Tower of Hanoi implementation. Best played in GUI version of Vim.

- Comes with two modes, a demo mode and a play mode. 
- You can start the game by using the command :Hanoi optionally passing the number of disks as an argument. 
- If no argument is passed, you are prompted to enter a value. 
- The maximum number of disks is determined based on the size of your vim window.
- You will be prompted to choose between demo or play mode.
- In demo mode, the script plays for you, just sit and relax.
- In play mode, you can use h, j, k, l keys to move the disks from pole to pole. The disk with dashes represents the current disk that you can move.
- Keys h and k select the current pole, and thus the top most disk on the pole.
- Keys k and j move the disk up and down.
- In play mode, you can pause the game by pressing <Space>, and come back by using :Hanoi command again.
- You can stop the game at any time by pressing <C-C> or <C-Break>

Good exerciese to practice hjkl key movements, if you are new to Vi realm :)
